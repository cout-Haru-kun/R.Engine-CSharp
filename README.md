# R.Engine-CSharp
 Old console application to modify windows registry with built-in or custom configuration made when i was 14



In order to run it you need to construct a first key with client key constructor, then process it into admin key constructor (I know there is other more simples ways in order to create license key)

Put the license key into conf.yml file of Latis R.Engine and run it


An exemple configuration file is provided if you want to use this program one time in your life
